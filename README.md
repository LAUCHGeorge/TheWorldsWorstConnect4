This is the world's worst Connect 4.

A Connect 4 Game I created to improve upon my Java skills.

What this project currently includes:
-  A quite buggy Connect 4

What this project is going to include in the future:
-  A more optimized Connect 4

If you are reading this and plan to look through this repo, 
feel free to give me some tips on how to improve my coding skills!

I do also want to mention that the first alpha of this connect 4 is even as of me writing this readme,
already incredibly old and INCREDIBLY fucked.

Thanks for reading! ~lauch | TheWorldsWorstConnect4
